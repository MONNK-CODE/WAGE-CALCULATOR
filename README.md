# WAGE-CALCULATOR

## Overview

The Wage Calculator is a Python program designed to compute the gross pay, total tax, and net pay for an employee based on their hourly wage, hours worked, and whether the work was performed on a holiday. The program provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input their pay details and receive a comprehensive summary of their earnings.

## Features

- Calculate gross pay with optional holiday pay bonus (50% increase).
- Compute Medicare, Social Security, and state income taxes (Illinois).
- Supports hours input in both decimal format and hours/minutes format.
- Provides a summary of total hours worked, gross pay, total tax, and net pay for multiple days.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script in a Python environment.
2. **Input Hourly Wage**: Enter your hourly wage when prompted.
3. **Enter Hours Worked**: Input the number of hours worked. You can use decimal format (e.g., `8.5`) or hours and minutes separated by a dot (e.g., `8.30`).
4. **Specify Holiday Work**: Indicate if the work was performed on a holiday by typing 'yes' or 'no'.
5. **Repeat for Multiple Days**: After each calculation, you will have the option to add another day's work or exit the program.
6. **View Summary**: At the end, a summary of total hours worked, gross pay, total tax, and net pay will be displayed.
